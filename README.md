=================

I'm ditching wordpress as a CMS and writing my own website from the ground up for the purposes of education. 

Current apps in this Django Project: 
/blog/ A simple blogging platform created as part of my final project for Intro to Computer Science at Haverford College. 
/pages/ Serving static webpages that do not require their own app.
